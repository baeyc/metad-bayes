# Comparison of performance and meta-cognition in two artificial languages

This repository contains code to perform a comparison of learning performance and meta-cognition between two artificial languages.

We used SDT (Signal Detection Theory) and a Bayesian approach to estimate the key parameters: d', meta-d' and Mratio, the ratio between these two quantities. The code is based on previous R code from ![Fleming (2017)](https://github.com/metacoglab/HMeta-d), but include some modifications to ensure a fully Bayesian approach for the estimation of d' and c.

We provide scripts for the analysis of the results, from computing tables to producing graphs.
